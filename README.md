# Spam-Detection
This model is a spam detection and email filtering application based on a Naive Bayes classifier. It utilizes Natural Language Processing techniques to preprocess the email text by removing special characters, numbers, and stopwords, and performs lemmatization for feature extraction. The TF-IDF vectorizer is used to convert the preprocessed text into numerical features. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails and achieves good performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for spam detection. It can be integrated into email systems to automatically filter and classify incoming emails, helping users to prioritize and manage their inbox efficiently while reducing the impact of spam.
